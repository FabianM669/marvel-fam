Questions for Will and Sarah

    Can we change the <a> tags to buttons?
        I'd like to intercept the relocation to add info (especially on 
        battleSetupView) and since we are doing it there, I'd like to 
        do it everywhere.

    I am adding a place for Search in BattleSetupView();


<h2>Search for your own hero</h2>
<input type="text" placeholder="ex: Spider_Man">
<button></button>
<!-- add class of "active" to see dropdown results
<div class="searchresults active">

NOTICE!!!  We changed this:  No <form> and input to button.

-->
<div class="searchresults">
    <ul class='searchView'>
    </ul>
</div>






The following two are different.  Which one shoud we copy?
<div class="character_1">
    <h2>Name of Character</h2>
    <div class="pre-pick">
        <h1>?</h1>
        <img src="" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="picked">
        <img src="" alt="">
    </div>
</div>

<img src="img/vs.png" alt="VS" class="versus">

<div class="character_2">
    <h2>Name of Character</h2>
    <div class="pre-pick">
        <h1>?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="picked">
        <img src="" alt="">
        <!-- the alt="" must be populated with the character's name -->
    </div>
